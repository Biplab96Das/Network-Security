Initially,client-file.txt and server-file.txt are empty.
step 1) Whatever text contents(numbers,character,symbols)want to include into file you want to send,write that into
        server-file.txt, save it.
step 2) Run 222cs2268_Q_3_server.py using the command "python3 222cs2268_Q_3_server.py".
step 3) Run 222cs2268_Q_3_client.py in another terminal.
step 4) Open client-file.txt,you will see server file has updated client file.That is sent to client by server
        We have also output the content of server-file on client socket.
